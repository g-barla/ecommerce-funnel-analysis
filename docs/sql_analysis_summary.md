## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overall Performance:
- Conversion Rate: 24.41%
- Cart Abandonment: 46.83%
- Total Purchases: 24,411

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. CART ABANDONMENT IS THE PRIMARY ISSUE
- 46.83% of users who add items to cart abandon before checkout
- This represents 23865 abandoned carts
- Estimated lost revenue: $2.4M annually

### 2. DEVICE PERFORMANCE VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY
- Best: Desktop (26.85% conversion)
- Worst: Mobile (22.12% conversion)
- Gap: 4.7 percentage points

### 3. SHIPPING COSTS DRIVE ABANDONMENT
- High shipping costs significantly increase cart abandonment
- Opportunity: Implement free shipping threshold

### 4. TRAFFIC SOURCE ROI VARIES
- Best: Direct (24.64% conversion)
- Should increase budget allocation to top performers

### 5. DISCOUNTS REDUCE ABANDONMENT
- Discounts improve conversion by +5.2 percentage points
- Reduce abandonment by -11.3 percentage points
- ROI positive for targeted discount campaigns

## RECOMMENDATIONS (PRIORITY ORDER)

1. **Optimize Mobile Checkout** (Highest Impact)
